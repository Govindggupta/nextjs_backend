#backend and api notes for the nextjs

prefer this for all : https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/nextjs-2/next-2-11 

when ever you want to use a cliend functionality such as {userstate , useeff , onclick or else } so to use that thing you need to write   "use client"   on the top of the file to make it cliet side rendering 

localhost/api/user can't be used as we are sending req to the own next server which is not great
so you should write the db logic into the file instead of writing it in route for fetching 
for get methods ig 

stop using 
const client = new Prismaclient() 

instead write a logic for the client in a db.ts , in which it create it only create the client only once even if we are reloading or making new file . 

this problem is seem in dev mode , so to solve this problem we do this step .

#server actions 
A function is made instead of making a post funciton and then that function is called in the cliend side side instead of making the post req 
Entries are directly added to the database with just call of a function , instead of making a post request to the server 

you have to write        "use server"         on the of the file to make it strictly server side file
so that it does not leak the information on the client side and many more reason , please google it imp to know . 
Can be integrated seamlessly with forms,
