#backend and api notes for the nextjs

prefer this for all : https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/nextjs-2/next-2-11 

when ever you want to use a cliend functionality such as {userstate , useeff , onclick or else } so to use that thing you need to write   "use client"   on the top of the file to make it cliet side rendering 

localhost/api/user can't be used as we are sending req to the own next server which is not great
so you should write the db logic into the file instead of writing it in route for fetching 
for get methods ig 

stop using 
const client = new Prismaclient() 

instead write a logic for the client in a db.ts , in which it create it only create the client only once even if we are reloading or making new file . 

#server actions
